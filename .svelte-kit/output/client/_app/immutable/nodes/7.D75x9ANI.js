After validating a Dockerfile, users can click the “Export” button to download a file named \`AxelBase-Docker-File-Validation-Report\`, with incremental suffixes like \`-1\`, \`-2\`, etc., for subsequent exports. This functionality is particularly valuable for archiving build histories, sharing with team members, or integrating into documentation processes, enhancing overall workflow efficiency.</p> <section class="mb-4"><h2 class="h4">Report Formats</h2> <p>AxelBase offers two export formats tailored to different needs:</p> <ul><li><strong>JSON</strong> — Ideal for automation, this format includes structured fields like timestamp, validation status, error/warning lists, line count, and the original Dockerfile content. It’s perfect for CI/CD pipelines or integration into developer tools.</li> <li><strong>TXT</strong> — Designed for readability, this version summarizes the validation results in plain text. It’s great for sharing with teammates or attaching to documentation.</li></ul> <p>Here’s a sample TXT report:</p> <pre><code>
AxelBase Dockerfile Validation Report

When a user selects JSON or TXT, AxelBase constructs the report based on the current validation state, ensuring accuracy. The incremental naming convention prevents overwriting previous exports, a feature refined based on user feedback to maintain file integrity. This attention to detail makes the export process seamless and reliable.</p> <p>By utilizing this feature, developers can streamline collaboration and documentation, turning validation results into actionable insights. Whether you’re preparing for a team handover or ensuring regulatory compliance, AxelBase’s export capability transforms raw data into a valuable resource, solidifying its role as an essential tool in the development toolkit.</p> <p class="mt-4"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary">Back to Blog</a></p></div>`);function S(s){var e=x();p(l=>{var c=b();m.title="Exporting Results (TXT/JSON) - AxelBase Blog",u(2),a(l,c)});var t=f(r(e),18),n=r(t);i(t),i(e),d(()=>g(n,"href",`${h??""}/blog`)),a(s,e)}export{S as component,B as universal};
