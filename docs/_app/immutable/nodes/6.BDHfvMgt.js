One of the most prevalent issues is specifying a missing base image, such as `FROM missing-image:latest`, which results in a “no such image” error during the build. Another frequent mistake is an incomplete `RUN` command, like `RUN`, without a subsequent executable, leading to a syntax error that halts the process. These issues, if undetected, can waste hours of debugging time, making pre-build validation essential.</p> <p>Additional common errors include invalid `COPY` commands, such as `COPY nonexistent.txt /app`, where the source file is absent, or misconfigured `EXPOSE` ports like `EXPOSE 3000a`, which violate Docker’s numeric-only rule. AxelBase’s real-time validation catches these mistakes by analyzing each line as you type, displaying red alerts with specific error messages. For instance, a typo in `WORKDIR /ap` (missing the second ‘p’) is flagged immediately, allowing quick correction before the build stage.</p> <h2 class="mt-4">Comprehensive Error Table</h2> <table class="table table-striped table-hover"><thead><tr><th>Error Type</th><th>Common Cause</th><th>Practical Fix</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Missing Base Image</td><td>Non-existent `FROM` value</td><td>Replace with `FROM node:18`</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete RUN</td><td>Missing command</td><td>Correct to `RUN echo "test"`</td></tr><tr><td>Invalid COPY</td><td>Non-existent source file</td><td>Verify with `COPY src /app`</td></tr><tr><td>Wrong EXPOSE</td><td>Non-numeric port</td><td>Use `EXPOSE 3000`</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 class="mt-4">Pro Tips for Error Prevention</h2> <ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item bg-dark-surface border-custom">Add comments to document each command’s purpose.</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-dark-surface border-custom">Validate incrementally as you edit the Dockerfile.</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-dark-surface border-custom">Export validation reports for team reviews and audits.</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-dark-surface border-custom">Test builds in a isolated environment before deployment.</li></ul> <p>With AxelBase, these common errors transform from obstacles into manageable tasks.
